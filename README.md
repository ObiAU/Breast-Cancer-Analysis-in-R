# Breast-Cancer-Analysis-in-R
 Data exploration, preprocessing and modelling of Breastcancer dataset from mlbench library in R. Mainly for R practice and out of interest. Breastcancer dataset seemed fairly interesting to preprocess and model. Some inspiration came from this article : https://rpubs.com/raviolli77/352956

The data set represents certain characteristics of breast tissue samples collected from 699 women in Wisconsin.

Purpose is threefold: clean the data set; perform initial exploratory analysis; perform logistic regression with best subset selection and model the resultant data set with respect to logistic regression, LDA, QDA.

Ultimately, I'll perform a comparative analysis (based on test error) on the models from which I'll draw conclusions.
